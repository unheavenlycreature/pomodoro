# Pomodoro Timer

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a technique used to break work down into intervals.
Typically, one will focus on work for 25 minutes at a time, broken up with 5 minute breaks in between. Each is known as a "pomodoro".
After four pomodoros, a longer break is taken.
